"""Tests for Executor's cognitive-stress-gate daemon_speech pairing.

The stress-gate pause speaks directly on the daemon's own OS audio
(pilot.system.voice.speak()), not the frontend's speechSynthesis --
without a paired notification, the user gets zero visual trace of the
10-second pause or why it's happening. daemon_speech must carry the exact
spoken phrase and is display-only (session.ts appends a chat bubble via
addSystemMessage; it must never also call speakText() for this
notification, or the phrase would be spoken twice).
