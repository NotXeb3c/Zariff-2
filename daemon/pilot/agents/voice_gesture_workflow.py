"""Durable, pausable, resumable multi-step workflow engine for voice/gesture-
triggered goals.

Workflow state is durable and restart-survivable, while each step delegates
to AutonomousExecutor's shared observe/act/verify loop. This keeps native-app
and browser grounding identical across typed and spoken autonomous tasks.

This engine drives the shared building blocks from durable, restart-survivable state
(VoiceGestureWorkflowStore) and supports genuine pause/resume: a goal can
span multiple separate voice commands or gesture inputs over time, not just
one uninterrupted run. Each step's own ActionPlan is checkpointed through
the existing, unmodified WorkflowCheckpointStore (keyed
"{workflow_id}:{step_index}"), exactly like server.py's resume_plan RPC
already does for a single plan.

Auto-chains steps by default (matching AutonomousExecutor's UX) — it only
stops and waits for external input on an explicit pause() request (state
PAUSED) or an ambiguous planning outcome (state WAITING_FOR_TRIGGER, e.g.
the planner couldn't produce a usable plan for a step and needs the user to
clarify). See pilot.security.gateway.InvocationSource.VOICE/GESTURE — this
is the first real call site wiring those profiles in.
